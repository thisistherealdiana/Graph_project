# Graph Project

In this project
- drawing three given functions
- denoting their intersection
- determining the intersection points
- finding the area of denoted region

The functions are
$$
\begin{aligned}
f_1 & = 3(\dfrac{1}{2(x+1)}+1) \\
f_2 & =  2.5x-9.5  \\
f_3 & = \dfrac{5}{x} 
\end{aligned}
$$

$$f_1 = 3\Big(\dfrac{1}{2(x+1)}+1\Big) $$

$$ f_2 = 2.5x-9.5 $$

$$ f_3 = \dfrac{5}{x} $$

The result can be seen below
